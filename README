Generates a table-based photoboard given either a directory of images, 
or a configuration file.  It makes use of imagemagic to resize the images 
for both the 'expanded' and 'thumbnail' images.

At the moment, the table generated is simply a 'click to view image' type.
The script supports alt text, some headings, and changing of colours.

Detailed description of how to use &c  is in the file itself.
